# Self Introduction

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.  

My name is **Mahesh Kumar**, I have over **6+ years of experience in AWS DevOps**. I’m also an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**.  

**Currently**, I've been working at **Fidelity National Financial since October 2021**, where I’ve been involved in  
1. Configuring the aws services with the help of Terraform  
2. Helping the developers in their deployments by writing the deployment pipelines using Jenkins  
3. Fixing the server vulnerabilities and configuration management using ansible Playbooks  
4. Involved in automations using shell script and python  
5. Working on alerts from the monitoring tools  
  
Before this, I worked with Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd for one year and Virtusa for one and a half years  
  
Coming to my Academic Qualifications, I completed my **B.Tech** in the stream of **Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2016 from Kuppam Engineering College**, which is affiliated with **JNTU Anantapur**.  
Prior to that,  I completed my **Intermediate in 2012 with 90.4%, and I completed my SSC in 2010 with 87%**.  

After completing my B.Tech in 2016, I initially pursued **UPSC training** with the aspiration of joining civil services. Although I could not qualify. 
Later, I joined **Teleperformance** in a **non-IT role**, where I developed strong communication skills. 
During that time, I explored my interest in AWS DevOps, then I **transitioned into the DevOps domain**.

A bit about my personal side – I was born and raised in Andhra Pradesh. I recently got married.  
  
Coming to my hobbies, I enjoy watching movies, especially thrillers. I also like to surf the internet and stay updated with new technologies.
