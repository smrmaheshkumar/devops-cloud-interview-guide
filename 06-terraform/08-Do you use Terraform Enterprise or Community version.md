"In my current role, we use the **Terraform Community (Open Source)** version, as it fits our infrastructure and team size well. We manage state using a remote backend on **AWS S3 with DynamoDB for state locking and consistency**, which gives us many of the collaboration benefits Terraform Cloud or Enterprise provides, but in a self-managed setup.

For version control and modularity, we maintain our Terraform code in Git repositories, follow a strict GitOps process, and use workspaces to separate environments like dev, staging, and production.

While I haven't used Terraform Enterprise directly, I'm familiar with its features like Sentinel policy enforcement, RBAC, and cost estimation, and I understand its value for organizations needing advanced governance, team management, and self-hosted solutions. If our team scales or compliance requirements grow, moving to Terraform Cloud or Enterprise would be a logical next step."
