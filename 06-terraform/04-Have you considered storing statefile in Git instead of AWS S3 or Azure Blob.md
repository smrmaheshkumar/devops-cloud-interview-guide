Storing Terraform **state files in Git is generally discouraged**, even though it may seem convenient.

### 🚫 **Why NOT to Store Terraform State in Git**

| Risk                               | Explanation                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Security Risk**                | The state file often contains **sensitive data** (like plaintext secrets, passwords, access keys). Committing it to Git—even in private repos—can expose secrets. |
| ❌ **No Locking**                   | Git doesn’t provide **state locking**, which means multiple people can run Terraform at the same time and corrupt the state.                                      |
| ❌ **No Remote Backend Support**    | You won’t get features like `terraform plan` working from multiple machines correctly.                                                                            |
| ❌ **Version History is Dangerous** | Every time you commit a new state, old versions (with secrets) remain in Git history unless you scrub them manually.                                              |
| ❌ **Manual Conflict Resolution**   | If multiple branches modify the state file, Git merges will break it, and resolving that is error-prone.                                                          |

### ✅ **Why Use Remote Backends like AWS S3 or Azure Blob**

| Feature               | Benefit                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔐 **Secure Storage** | Supports encryption (e.g., SSE-S3 or customer-managed keys).                               |
| 🔒 **State Locking**  | With DynamoDB (for AWS) or Blob lease (Azure), it prevents concurrent state modifications. |
| 🔁 **Versioning**     | You get automatic history of state changes via S3/Azure versioning.                        |
| 🌍 **Collaboration**  | Enables team collaboration without worrying about syncing or corrupting state.             |

### 🔄 Exception – When Git *Might* Be OK

Only in **local, personal, non-prod experiments** where:

* No sensitive data exists in the state.
* You're the only one working on the project.
* You fully understand the risk.

---

### ✅ Recommendation

**Use remote backends (like AWS S3 + DynamoDB, or Azure Blob + state lock)** for all shared or production Terraform environments. Git should only track your Terraform code — not the state.
