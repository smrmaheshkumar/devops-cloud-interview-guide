### ❓ **Interview Question: Have you heard about OpenTofu? Do you think it is better than Terraform?**

### ✅ **Sample Answer:**

**"Yes, I’ve heard about OpenTofu. It’s an open-source fork of Terraform, created by the community—backed by projects like Gruntwork and companies like Harness—after HashiCorp changed the Terraform license from MPL to BSL (Business Source License) in 2023. OpenTofu was launched under the Linux Foundation to ensure Terraform remains truly open-source and community-driven.**

**In terms of capabilities, OpenTofu is currently feature-parallel with Terraform. It supports the same HCL language, providers, modules, and workflows, so it’s compatible with most existing Terraform configurations.**

**As for whether it’s 'better'—that depends on the context. If a company strongly prefers or requires a truly open-source license for legal or philosophical reasons, OpenTofu is a great choice. It also shows strong momentum from the open-source community. On the other hand, if you’re heavily integrated into Terraform Cloud or Enterprise features (like Sentinel or commercial support), staying with Terraform might make more sense.**

**Personally, I think OpenTofu is a promising alternative, especially for teams that want long-term flexibility and community governance over their infrastructure as code tooling."**
