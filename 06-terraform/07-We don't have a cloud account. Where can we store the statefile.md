If you **don‚Äôt have a cloud account** (like AWS, Azure, or GCP), you still have several options for storing Terraform state files securely and collaboratively. Here's a breakdown:

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Alternatives Without Cloud Accounts

### 1. **Terraform Cloud (Free Tier) ‚Äì Easiest & Cloud-Free Setup**

* **Pros**:

  * Free for small teams.
  * Offers **remote state storage**, **locking**, and **version history**.
  * No need to manage your own backend infrastructure.
* **Cons**:

  * Requires Terraform Cloud account (from HashiCorp).
  * Data stored on their infrastructure (but secure).

**How to Use:**

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "your-org-name"

    workspaces {
      name = "your-workspace-name"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Self-Hosted Backend with HTTP Server + Locking Support**

You can store the state on your **own HTTP(S) server**.

* **Pros**:

  * Complete control over storage.
* **Cons**:

  * You must implement or configure **locking** support yourself.
  * Requires web server + auth setup.

Example backend block:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "http" {
    address = "https://your-internal-server.com/terraform-state"
    lock_address = "https://your-internal-server.com/lock"
    unlock_address = "https://your-internal-server.com/unlock"
    username = "admin"
    password = "password"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Git-Based State Storage (Not Recommended, But Possible for Small/Local Use)**

* **Pros**:

  * Easy to implement (just commit the file).
* **Cons**:

  * ‚ùå No state locking ‚Üí risk of corruption.
  * ‚ùå Git history will contain sensitive data.
  * ‚ùå Not secure by default.

Use only for:

* Small local projects
* Learning or training environments
* Single user only

---

### 4. **Self-Hosted File Share (e.g., NFS, SMB, Samba)**

* Store state files in a **shared filesystem** accessible to your team.
* Still suffers from **no locking** unless you implement a locking mechanism.

## üõë What to Avoid

| Option               | Why Not?                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub/GitLab repos  | Insecure, lacks locking, exposes secrets in history |
| Emailing state files | Dangerous and not trackable                         |
| Google Drive/Dropbox | No locking, no control over file access concurrency |

## üîê Final Recommendations

| Goal                        | Option                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Easiest with no infra setup | ‚úÖ **Terraform Cloud Free Tier**                     |
| Full control on-prem        | ‚úÖ **HTTP backend with locking**                     |
| Testing/Learning            | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Local or Git**, but be careful                 |
| Collaborative without cloud | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Self-hosted file share + manual coordination** |
