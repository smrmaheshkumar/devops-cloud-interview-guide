### 📘 What is a **CRD** in Kubernetes?

**CRD** stands for **Custom Resource Definition**.

It allows you to **extend Kubernetes** by defining your own custom resource types—**just like Pods, Deployments, Services**, etc.—but tailored to your application's needs.
 
---

### 🧱 In Simple Terms

* Kubernetes has built-in resources (Pods, Deployments, Services)
* You can **create your own resource types** using a **CRD**
* Once registered, you can **create, read, update, delete (CRUD)** those resources with `kubectl` just like any other

---

### 📦 Example Use Case

You want a custom resource called `BackupJob` to represent backup tasks:

1. Define a `BackupJob` **CRD**
2. Create `BackupJob` resources in YAML
3. Optionally write a **controller** (operator) that watches these and performs logic

---

### 📄 Example CRD YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: backupjobs.myorg.io
spec:
  group: myorg.io
  names:
    kind: BackupJob
    plural: backupjobs
    singular: backupjob
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                schedule:
                  type: string
                target:
                  type: string
```

---

### 🧾 Then You Can Create Resources Like This:

```yaml
apiVersion: myorg.io/v1
kind: BackupJob
metadata:
  name: daily-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  target: "database"
```

And apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f daily-backup.yaml
```

### 🛠️ Tools That Use CRDs

* **Cert-Manager** (`Certificate`, `Issuer`)
* **Prometheus Operator** (`ServiceMonitor`)
* **ArgoCD / Argo Workflows**
* **Istio**, **Knative**, etc.
