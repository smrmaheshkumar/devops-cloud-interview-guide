### Tell us about your project in your current organization?

Currently I am working as a DevOps engineer for Title and Insurance project. And as part of this project, there are multiple micro services. 
I take care of infrastructure needs for those micro services. I take care of deployment, build configuration, everything related to those micro services. 
And as part of that, I work on TerraForm, I work on Kubernetes, I work on Ansible, I work on AWS, because these services are deployed on AWS. 

This is rough about my current project. 

Within Fidelity there are multiple projects. As a senior engineer, I don't work with one dedicated team, but I'm actually working with three development teams. 

I'm working as a teammate for the DevOps engineering team, where I take care of requirements of three development teams, 
and I try to share my work with the junior engineers within the team. 

I primarily work on the design and implementation is shared between junior engineers and me as Senior DevOps engineer. 

 Using TerraForm, I deployed two tier architecture application, or I create infrastructure for a three tier architecture Microsoft is within the payments team.
