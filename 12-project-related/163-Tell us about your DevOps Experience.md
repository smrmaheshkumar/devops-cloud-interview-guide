### Tell us about your DevOps Experience?
Hey, my name is Mahesh, and currently I'm working at Fidelity National Financial organization. I'm part of Title Insurance project,

As a part of my day to day activities in the current organization, I work on CICD, pipelines, GitHub actions is my primary expertise.
So we have multiple repositories in this organization. We have multiple micro services. I'm one of the key members who work on GitHub actions, 
and I build robust CICD pipelines.

Apart from that, my major activity also includes writing infrastructure as code using TerraForm.
So I work with multiple development teams where they have request for infrastructure creation, 
and whenever request comes to the DevOps team, I'm one of the team members who pick up the TerraForm related activities, 
or infrastructure as code related activities, and deliver work through TerraForm. 

Primarily, I like building TerraForm related code in the modular approach. So I also work in creating TerraForm modules and putting that in a centralized location.
Apart from that, all our applications are deployed to AWS, which is our primary cloud platform. 

So I work on various AWS services and also on the observability part we don't have a SRE engineering team here so observability is also part of our team,

Whenever it comes to scripting I prefer scripting in Bash or Python.
