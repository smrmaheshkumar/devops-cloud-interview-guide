### What is your Contribution in the Team?

In the current team, we have six DevOps engineers, and we work with two to three development teams, where each development team creates a request to us on the JIRA platform. 
So once in two weeks, we look at these JIRA tickets and we try to prioritize what tasks we will be working over that two weeks of time as a senior incident, 

I take the responsibility of deciding the priority. If I'm not sure about the priority, I will get in touch with the management or relevant stakeholders. 
We also have a Scrum Master who will overlook at the complete sprint planning related activities. 

But as a team member, I ensure the right priority items are picked up on the next couple of weeks. 

Along with that, I primarily focus on designing the things, apart from tasks that are assigned to me. 

For example, recently, I designed modules in TerraForm that are not existing in the organization. 

We did not have a module for Eks, so I took the responsibility for designing end to end EKS module.
So that going ahead, nobody has to write TerraForm code for EKS from the scratch. 

My primary skills as senior member of the team are Kubernetes, TerraForm, Docker and AWS. 

So I also act as a subject matter expertise with respect to these skills. If there are any questions about these skills, I am the point of contact. 

If I am not sure about certain things about these skills, I will go back and try to understand from the documentation or reach out to the support from AWS. 

One of my regular activities is also identify the gaps. As DevOps team, we work with various development teams, and we document and document a lot of things. 
If I Identify that particular documentation is missing or release notes is missing, I work on that documentation to clear the gaps. 

Also, I focus on training the junior engineers. We have two to three junior engineers in the team. 
I take responsibility to train those junior engineers and bring them to speed. 

This is a primary contribution that I do in my current project.
