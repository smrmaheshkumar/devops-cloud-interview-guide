### Q) Please walk us through a typical day at your work?

Hey So as part of my day to day work, I start with daily stand up. So in my current organization, we follow Agile methodology, 
and the first meeting that we have is the daily stand up. 
Then I update what is the work that I've done yesterday? If I am blocked, I will explain that I am blocked because of this reason, 
and I'm looking for help from XYZ person, and I will try to unblock myself. 

Once the daily stand up is done, I will head to JIRA, which is our ticketing platform or project management platform. 
I'll try to see what are the different tasks that are assigned to me, and I will look at the high priority task first. 
And because I work as a DevOps engineer, there can be some adhoc requests as well. I'll try to see if there is any adhoc request that is of highest priority, 
but most likely, because we have already done the sprint planning, I will try to work on the high priority request that is already assigned to me. 

I'll continue to work on the high priority task. 

So most likely the tasks are going to be on TerraForm infrastructure as code and I am one of the subject matter expertise in this particular space. 

So majority of the critical tasks related to terraform are assigned to me. 

Apart from this, the task can be related to Kubernetes, or the task can be related to Ansible. I'll continue to work on them. 
Then we usually have couple of meetings in the afternoon, and these meetings are with the architect, or these meetings are with other developers. 
And I try to actively participate in these meetings.

Towards the end of the day, I'll try to update the JIRA trackers, because other DevOps engineers or other team members might reference the JIRA ticket,
especially our management is very focused on Jira, so I'll try to update everything that I've done in the JIRA.

This is how my typical day looks.
