### ‚úÖ **How to Explain ‚Äì DevOps Engineer Perspective**

> üó£Ô∏è *‚ÄúI worked on a project that supports the title insurance and real estate closing process for a large financial services company. The platform handles customer onboarding, document processing, title search automation, and closing coordination.‚Äù*

---

### üîß Key DevOps Responsibilities to Mention:

#### 1. **Infrastructure Automation**

* Provisioned and managed infrastructure using **Terraform**/**CloudFormation** on AWS (or Azure/GCP).
* Set up VPCs, EC2, RDS, S3, Load Balancers, and other cloud resources.
* Used **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to ensure repeatability and version control.

#### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**

* Designed CI/CD pipelines using **Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI** to automate:

  * Code build and test
  * Artifact deployment to staging and production
* Integrated with tools like **SonarQube** (for code quality), **Trivy** (for image scanning).

#### 3. **Containerization & Orchestration**

* Dockerized microservices related to title document validation, insurance policy issuance, and escrow handling.
* Deployed on **Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)** with **Helm** for packaging and deployment.
* Implemented **horizontal scaling** for high-volume periods (e.g., month-end closings).

#### 4. **Monitoring & Logging**

* Integrated **Prometheus + Grafana** for real-time system and app metrics.
* Used **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **CloudWatch** for log aggregation and tracing.
* Set up **alerting** for API failures, latency spikes, or escrow fund transfer delays.

#### 5. **Security & Compliance**

* Implemented **IAM roles**, **Secrets Management** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager / Vault).
* Enabled **encryption-at-rest & in-transit** for sensitive documents and title reports.
* Automated **audit trails** and **compliance checks** for data privacy (like SOX/PCI if applicable).

#### 6. **Collaboration & Automation**

* Used tools like **Slack + ChatOps**, **JIRA**, **Confluence** to coordinate with QA, Dev, and Product.
* Automated certificate generation (for issued title policies), email notifications for closings.

### üß† Example Summary (Interview-style)

> *‚ÄúIn the Title Insurance & Real Estate Closing project, I was responsible for setting up and maintaining cloud infrastructure using Terraform on AWS. I built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins for multiple microservices involved in title search, document processing, and closing workflow automation. I also dockerized these services and deployed them to Kubernetes (EKS). Monitoring was done via Prometheus and Grafana, and we used centralized logging with ELK stack. I ensured secure handling of sensitive customer/title data using secrets management and role-based access controls.‚Äù*
